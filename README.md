# Natalia Web App 1234

Welcome to the **Natalia Web App**, a project I built with passion and purpose! This app is designed to be a clean, interactive, and educational platform that offers both educational web apps and video resources. The goal is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing experience for anyone interested in expanding their learning.

## Features

- **Hero Section**: Welcomes users with a clean and engaging intro.
- **Navbar**: Smooth navigation across the app's sections with a modern and responsive menu.
- **Educational Web Apps**: A section that showcases a collection of educational web applications.
- **Educational Videos**: Learn through video content that's easily accessible within the app.
- **Contact Modal**: Allows users to easily get in touch via a contact modal form, triggered through the floating envelope icon.

## Tech Stack 

This project is built using the following tools:

- **React**: The core of the app, creating a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation between sections.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For quick, beautiful, and responsive styling.
- **Framer Motion**: Adding smooth animations to make the user experience more enjoyable.
- **React Icons**: For modern iconography, making the app look professional and sleek.

How It Works
The Navbar component controls navigation and includes a cool contact modal triggered by the floating envelope icon that appears when the user scrolls. The app integrates sections like educational apps and videos, ensuring that learning resources are just a click away.

Navbar
The navigation menu supports both desktop and mobile views, with a neat animation thanks to `Framer Motion.` The menu also includes a contact option that pops up a contact form modal for easy communication.

Hero Section
The Hero component welcomes users with a smooth design and directs them to the core content of the app.

Educational Apps & Videos
These sections offer easy access to educational resources. The educational apps and videos are organized with user experience in mind, making learning feel intuitive and fun.

Contact Modal
The Contact Modal is a floating envelope button that shows up after the user scrolls down, encouraging interaction. When clicked, it triggers a sleek modal for users to get in touch.
